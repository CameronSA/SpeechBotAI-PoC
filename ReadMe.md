# Speech Bot Proof of Concept

This is a proof of concept for a completely local conversational speech to speech AI. It is effectively a series of experiments for myself to figure out the different technologies involved and how to use them - so definitely not intended for production use. To try it for yourself. Make sure you have Ollama running with the `phi3:mini` model installed. The most reliable app so far is the `speech_to_speech.py` script in `FullSpeechToSpeech`. Be sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first
