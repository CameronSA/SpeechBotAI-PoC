# Speech Bot Proof of Concept

This is a proof of concept for a completely local conversational speech to speech AI using Faster Whisper for speech to text conversion, Ollama for AI response generation, and the built in SpeechSynthesizer for windows for text to speech.

## Usage

Requires an Ollama server to be running.
Run `stt_server.py` to start the speech to text server
Run the `LocalAI` csproj to start the main application
